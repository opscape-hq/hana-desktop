# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements SSH connection management and tabbed interface functionality for a Tauri-based terminal application. The system will allow users to establish SSH connections to remote servers and manage multiple connections through a tabbed interface with proper state management using Svelte 5 runes. The implementation focuses on core functionality without comprehensive UI design, prioritizing connection management and tab state control over SvelteKit routing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage SSH connections so that I can connect to remote servers securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides SSH connection details (hostname, port, username, authentication method) THEN the system SHALL validate the connection parameters
2. WHEN a user initiates an SSH connection THEN the system SHALL establish a secure connection using the provided credentials
3. WHEN an SSH connection is established THEN the system SHALL maintain the connection state and provide terminal access
4. IF SSH connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages with connection failure details
5. WHEN a user disconnects from SSH THEN the system SHALL properly close the connection and clean up resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple SSH connections through tabs so that I can work with multiple servers simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new SSH connection THEN the system SHALL create a new tab for that connection
2. WHEN multiple tabs exist THEN the system SHALL allow users to switch between tabs seamlessly
3. WHEN a tab is active THEN the system SHALL display the corresponding SSH session content
4. WHEN a user closes a tab THEN the system SHALL terminate the associated SSH connection and remove the tab
5. WHEN no tabs remain THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state or default view

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper state management for SSH connections and tabs so that the application maintains consistent behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize with proper state management using Svelte 5 runes
2. WHEN SSH connection state changes THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding tab state reactively
3. WHEN tab state changes THEN the system SHALL persist relevant connection information
4. IF the application is closed with active connections THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup all SSH connections
5. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain individual terminal session states

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SSH functionality to use modern libraries and standards so that the implementation is secure and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing SSH connections THEN the system SHALL use the latest stable SSH library for Rust/Tauri
2. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL support multiple authentication methods (password, key-based)
3. WHEN managing terminal sessions THEN the system SHALL use appropriate terminal emulation libraries
4. WHEN implementing state management THEN the system SHALL use Svelte 5 runes for reactive state
5. WHEN handling security THEN the system SHALL follow SSH security best practices and proper credential handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want basic terminal functionality within SSH sessions so that I can execute commands on remote servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an SSH connection is active THEN the system SHALL provide a terminal interface for command execution
2. WHEN a user types commands THEN the system SHALL send input to the remote server through the SSH connection
3. WHEN the remote server sends output THEN the system SHALL display the output in the terminal interface
4. WHEN terminal sessions are active THEN the system SHALL handle terminal resizing and scrollback
5. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve terminal history and current state for each session
